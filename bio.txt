Kira Abell
A Brief Autobiography
--------------------------

I’ve travelled over four-thousand miles to get to where I am. Born and raised in Miami, Florida, ten years ago, I undertook a two-month car journey to Seattle, Washington, stopping at various sights along the way. To this day, it remains my greatest adventure.

Now, I’m on a different sort of journey, one of self-improvement as I pursue a degree in the field of web development. I have an interest in working with non-profit, philanthropic, charitable organizations, which is what I am ultimately hoping to do with my degree and the skills I develop while working toward it. In the 21st century, it is important for organizations of all sorts to have a viable web presence; this is not limited only to for-profit businesses; non-profits need to have it as well in order to spread awareness of their cause, maximize reach, and obtain the donations they need to continue with their good and important work.

On a more personal note, while my played library isn't very extensive, I consider myself to be a gamer. I used to be an active player of World of Warcraft, which I played for about ten years. In addition, I was an officer in a few different guilds, as well as a raid leader. Helping to organize a bunch of people (up to 25!) is no easy task! While I've been out of that scene for a few years, I'm hoping that experience will serve me well in the years to come.

My primary game genre is singleplayer RPG, and more specifically Skyrim and Dragon Age. I am an avid modder of both of those games, both in use and mod creation.

Finally, I try to maintain my fitness through running, both indoors and out, when the weather permits. Flying down Seattle’s hills is exhilarating until you have to go back up again!
